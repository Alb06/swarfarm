        <h1>Import Summoner's War JSON</h1>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Download the latest release of the <a class="text-decoration-none" href="https://github.com/Xzandro/sw-exporter/releases/latest">SW-Exporter</a> program.</li>
            <li>Follow the instructions provided to capture your Summoner's War account data.</li>
            <li>Find the acctname-1234567.json file and upload it here. The name and numbers in the filename will be different.</li>
            <li><strong>Optional:</strong> You can import a friend visit data file, which is named 'friendname-1234567-visit.json'
                <ul>
                    <li>You might want to do this if you can't run SW-Exporter yourself, but have a friend who can.</li>
                    <li>This data will be imported into the currently logged in SWARFARM account.</li>
                    <li>This will not import unequipped rune inventory! This data is only available to the actual account owner, not friends.</li>
                    <li>If you already have runes in your SWARFARM profile inventory, you can choose not to delete them.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            For your first upload, it is recommended to clear your profile or you will end up with a lot of duplicates. For subsequent uploads your account will by synced automatically.
            Please report any issues by leaving feedback <a class="text-decoration-none" href="{% url 'feedback:issue_add' %}">here</a>. You can also email your .json file to swarfarm@porksmash.com so I can investigate specific issues.
