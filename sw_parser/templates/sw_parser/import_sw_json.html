        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/kakaroto/SWParser/releases/latest">SWParser</a> program created by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/kakarotoks">/u/kakarotoks</a></li>
            <li>Follow it's instructions to parse your pcap file</li>
            <li>Upload the .json file that does not have any suffix appended to the file name. It will be approximately 1MB and be named something like '1234567910.json'</li>
            <li>For your first upload, it is recommended to clear your profile. For subsequent uploads I can sync your monsters automatically. Note: At this time, monsters removed in-game are not removed from SWARFARM. This'll be fixed very soon</li>
            <li>The upload and processing can take up to about 60 seconds so be patient.</li>
        </ol>
